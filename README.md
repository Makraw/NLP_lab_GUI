# NLP_lab_GUI
This is a personal repo to hold the code making the NLP lab work graphical. It's only personal until I can get a working version to put into the standard NLP repo


This code, as it is written, will ONLY work on Freeman in the lab, provided it even works at all. The code needs to be expanded before it will be usable on any other computer that does not have an identical file structure to the one found on Freeman.

As it stands now, this code will be designed to work only on Linux since it relies on the .os module to send terminal commands that don't work on Windows
