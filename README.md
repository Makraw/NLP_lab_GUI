# NLP_lab_GUI
This is a personal repo to hold the code making the NLP lab work graphical. It's only personal until I can get a working version to put into the standard NLP repo

The current version should work on any linux machine, but it is not entirely ready to be used.

The Next step for this repo is to get a completely working version put together and to solve the as of yet still problematic "milvus" error, for which a single source has not yet been isolated.
